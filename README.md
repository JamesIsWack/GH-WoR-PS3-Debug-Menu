# GH-WoR-PS3-Debug-Menu
Debug Menu for GH:WoR. Requires DEX (maybe?) and some patience.
# Install
To install, take the `QB.PAK.PS3` and `QB.PAB.PS3`, and copy to `DATA/COMPRESSED/PS3/PAK`, then take the EBOOT.BIN that you think will work (noncompressed, NPDRM should) and install that to `USRDIR`. No testing so far has been done to prove this works. Let me know if you have issues.
# Requirements
A CEX2DEX'd PS3, a DECR/DECH (`TOOL/TEST`), a copy of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, CFW installed (REBUG REX/DREX, EVILNAT 4.89.3 PEX/DPEX), and the supplied files.
